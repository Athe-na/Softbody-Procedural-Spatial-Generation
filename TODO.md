# TO DO:

## Large Scale:

- Implement graph generation according to Jess Martin's complex approach in *Algorithmic Beauty of Buildings: Methods for Procedural Building Generation*.

- Define and implement SoftBody to partition translation. (Creating walls and rooms from a terminal SoftBody cluster)

- Finalize SoftBody physics.
    
    - Possibly shift to force based architecture (where each PointMass would keep track of forces on it and adjust its accel values accordingly)

- 

## Small Scale:

- Implement real-time adjustment

- Create GUI

    - Implement buttons and text boxes

- Cull overlapping Point/Edge collisions

- Add more SoftBody types
