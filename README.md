# Softbody Procedural Spatial Generation

This method for procedural spatial generation is based on the conception that softbodies offer a meaningfully verisimilar means to generating indoor spaces. Still in heavy development. This does not represent the final algorithm, and is primarily a means of testing softbody based generation performance and output for my paper *Soft Bodies as a Procedural Approach to Indoor Spaces*.

See TODO.md for a list of planned features and bugfixes.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE:
To play the simulation, run this command in your terminal from the project folder:
python3 SquishingDinosaurs.py <WindowWidth(px)> <WindowHeight(px)> 0 <RandomSeed>

Currently supported hotkeys:
Pause Simulation = spacebar
(While paused) step forward one frame = s
Reset Simulation = r
